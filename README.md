## Technical Details

- **React 18**: Modern React with hooks
- **Tone.js**: Web Audio API wrapper for synthesizer functionality
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Vite**: Fast build tool and development server

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome/Chromium (recommended)
- Firefox
- Safari
- Edge

**Note**: Web Audio API support is required. Some older browsers may not work properly.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The built files will be in the `dist/` directory, ready for deployment to any static hosting service.

## Deploying to GitHub Pages

### Option 1: Automatic Deployment (Recommended)

1. **Push your code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to your repository on GitHub
   - Click on "Settings" tab
   - Scroll down to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy your app

3. **Access your live app**
   - Your app will be available at: `https://yourusername.github.io/BigSoundGen`
   - Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username

### Option 2: Manual Deployment

1. **Update the homepage URL in package.json**
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/BigSoundGen"
   ```

2. **Install gh-pages**
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev gh-pages
   ```

3. **Deploy**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

4. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   - Go to repository Settings â†’ Pages
   - Select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "gh-pages" branch
   - Your app will be live at the URL specified in package.json

### Option 3: Using GitHub CLI

```bash
# Build the project
npm run build

# Deploy using GitHub CLI
gh-pages -d dist
```

## Important Configuration Steps

### Before Deploying:

1. **Update the homepage URL in package.json**
   ```json
   "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/BigSoundGen"
   ```
   Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.

2. **Update the base path in vite.config.js**
   ```javascript
   base: '/BigSoundGen/',
   ```
   Replace `BigSoundGen` with your repository name if different.

3. **Test locally with production build**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run preview
   ```

### Repository Setup:

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**
   - Repository name: `BigSoundGen` (or your preferred name)
   - Make it public for free GitHub Pages hosting
   - Don't initialize with README (since we already have one)

2. **Push your code**
   ```bash
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   git branch -M main
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/BigSoundGen.git
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Troubleshooting GitHub Pages:

- **404 Error**: Check that the `base` path in vite.config.js matches your repository name
- **Assets not loading**: Ensure the `homepage` field in package.json is correct
- **Build fails**: Check the GitHub Actions logs in your repository's "Actions" tab
- **Audio not working**: GitHub Pages serves over HTTPS, which is required for Web Audio API

## Customization

The synthesizer is built with modular components, making it easy to:

- Add new waveforms
- Implement additional effects
- Modify the UI layout
- Add MIDI controller support
- Extend the keyboard range

## Troubleshooting

### Audio Not Working
- Ensure your browser supports Web Audio API
- Check that audio is not muted in your browser/system
- Try refreshing the page
- Some browsers require user interaction before playing audio

### Performance Issues
- Close other audio applications
- Reduce the number of simultaneous notes
- Check browser developer tools for errors
